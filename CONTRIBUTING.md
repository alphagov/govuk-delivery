We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.

2. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests.

3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need
a test!

4. Make the test pass.

5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

We'll review the changes as quickly as we can.

Your pull request will be even eaasier for us to review if you:

* Clearly explain the need your change is solving and/or
* Include tests that fail without your code, and pass with it
* Update the documentation and README as appropriate
